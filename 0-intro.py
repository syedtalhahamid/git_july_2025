"""
Git is a version control system.
It helps developers keep track of changes in their code, 
collaborate with others, and roll back to earlier versions 
if something goes wrong.

Think of Git like a time machine for your code:
It saves snapshots of your project (called commits).
You can go back to old versions anytime.
You can work with teams without overwriting each other's code.
